# Laravel Project

This is a Laravel project. The following instructions will guide you through the process of setting it up on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) >= 8.1
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) - Dependency Manager for PHP
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime for compiling assets
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version Control System

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### 2. Install PHP Dependencies

Run Composer to install the PHP dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment File

Create a `.env` file from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 4. Generate Application Key

Generate the application key for your Laravel project:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Configure the Database

- Create a new database in your preferred database management system (e.g., MySQL).
- Update the `.env` file with your database credentials:

```dotenv
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```

### 6. Run Migrations

Run the database migrations to set up your tables:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 7. Install JavaScript Dependencies

Install the required JavaScript dependencies via npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 8. Compile Assets

You can compile assets using Laravel Mix. For development (non-minified assets):

```bash
npm run dev
```

For production (minified assets):

```bash
npm run prod
```

### 9. Serve the Application

Start the Laravel development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

You can now access the application at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
